# password-generator
## Description
In this task i had to create an application that generated random  password for a user that was between 8 and 128, that had to include at least one character type. To do this i used a prompt connected to an IF statement to make the user choose between a number between  8 and 128 and if the IF statement was false a message would appear telling the user to choice a number between 8 and 128. Next i had to check if the user wanted one of the character types by using confirm to get a boolean value true or false and placed the length and the boolean values into an object so that i could the data later on. I learned about functions so i created a function that would would generate a random number. In my next function i got the results from my first function that had the object as well as create an empty arrat and used an if statement with the dot notion to see if the user wanted that character type in there password if true if use for in loop to iterate the character type in the empty array once that use done, i used a for loop  with the condition having the length of characters the user selected and inside the for loop i used the random number function to select random characters from the array to create the password.
